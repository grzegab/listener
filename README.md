# Listener
To listen for responses and debug them, e.g. webhooks from mail service.

When working on local dev there is no access from "the world". So gateway must be used to read any responses  (and later on sen this response through postman)

## Stack
GO for handling HTTP requests
MongoDB for storing information
Next.js (React + Typescript) for presentation

## Initial work
Greg, Lord of Mailgun Messages, Master of Redis Realms, Messenger of Symfony Secrets, Champion of Domain-Driven Development, Guardian of PHPUnit Proclamations, and Sage of PHP Sorcery
